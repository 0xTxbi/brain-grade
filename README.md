## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that empowers our
  codebase with a robust type system, enabling early error detection and
  enhanced code documentation. TypeScript aids in building maintainable and
  scalable applications, particularly critical in large-scale projects.

- **Next.js**: A cutting-edge React framework that harnesses server-side
  rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering (CSR) capabilities, offering optimal
  performance and enhanced SEO benefits. Next.js enables seamless routing, code
  splitting, and automatic server-side rendering to optimize the user
  experience.

- **Express.js**: A minimalist and robust web application framework built on top
  of Node.js, providing a simple yet efficient way to handle HTTP requests and
  build scalable APIs. Express.js facilitates middleware usage, routing, and
  error handling, empowering developers to create high-performance server-side
  logic.

- **React-Hook-Form**: A powerful form management library that leverages React
  hooks to streamline form state management and validation. This lightweight and
  performant library enables us to build complex forms with ease while
  maintaining the scalability and maintainability of our codebase.

- **Zod**: A forward-thinking TypeScript-first schema validation library that
  enhances the robustness of our application by ensuring type safety and data
  integrity. With Zod, we can precisely define data structures and validate user
  input, mitigating potential runtime errors and improving the overall code
  quality.

- **Axios**: A versatile and feature-rich HTTP client that seamlessly handles
  API requests from the client-side. Axios simplifies error handling, request
  and response interception, and data transformation, optimizing the efficiency
  and reliability of our data fetching processes.

- **SWR (Stale-While-Revalidate)**: A cutting-edge React Hooks library that
  elevates our data fetching capabilities. SWR enables automatic caching and
  revalidation of data, reducing redundant API requests and providing an
  excellent user experience with minimal latency.

Through the strategic integration of these tools, Braingrade achieves top-tier
performance, security, and maintainability. A meticulous selection of the
aforementioned tools was made to ensure that our web application adheres to
industry best practices and delivers unparalleled value to our users.
